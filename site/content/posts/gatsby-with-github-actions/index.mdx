[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) appear to be the static site generator with the most traction, by far. I was delighted with how fast
and easy it was to generate a decent looking site for Tab Groupie.

However I also needed to build and host the site. As the site is about some software beeing developed on Github
is was quite natural to build using GitHub Actions and host on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I made a couple of design choices:
### Monorepo
The sources for the Gatsby site are version controlled in the very same GitHub repo as the software. This will
make it possible to write documentation and code in lockstep. It appears as Gatsby by default assumes that it'll live
by its own in the root of a repo, but it was quite content to live in a [/site](https://github.com/nordstrand/tab-groupie/tree/master/site)
subfolder after twisting some knobs.

### No third-party actions
I'd really like to use no third-party actions in my GitHub Actions workflow. Third-party actions would in my case 
need to have write access to the repo, introducing a significant vector of [Supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack).
The threat model goes something like this: the author of a GitHub Action gets hacked and the attacker introduce
malicious code in the action that e.g. steals the access token of the users of said action. 

Pinning usage of the action to a certain known good tag [will not really help](https://julienrenaux.fr/2019/12/20/github-actions-security-risk/)
as tags could be trivially overwritten by the attacker in this case. You could pin on
a git SHA-1, but in light of recent years [SHA-1 collision attacks](https://shattered.io/) this also feels somewhat dubious.

### Minimize version control of derived data
Gatsby builds a static site from basically markdown source files. The build product needs to checked into the git repo
in order for GitHub Pages to serve it. I really don't like to bloat my repos by keeping derived data under version 
control. However, by keeping the build product on a seperate branch the tip of which gets amended and forced pushed 
on every build, I'll only ever have <i>one</i> - the most recent - version of the site checked in.

### My GitHub actions Workflow
```yaml
name: publish-site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout master branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: master
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: build site from sources
        run: |
          cd site
          npm install
          npm run-script build

      - name: clone and checkout gh-pages branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: gh-pages
          persist-credentials: true
          path: temp          

      - name: move site sources to gh-pages clone
        run: |
          find temp/ -mindepth 1  -maxdepth 1 ! -name .git -exec rm -rvf {} \;
          mv site/public/* temp/

      - name: push gh-pages branch
        run: |
          cd temp/
          git config user.name github-actions
          git config user.email github-actions@github.com
          git add .
          git commit --amend -m "Generated $(date) from $GITHUB_SHA"
          git push --force origin gh-pages
```
